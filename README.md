The player has the decision to hit, stand, or if the dealer gets an Ace as the first card they can insure that hand. The dealer will show only the first card till the player stands in which case the dealer will draw till they are at a total value of 16 or above. The dealer and player will compare cards to see in the end to see who has a higher value than the other without going over 21.
